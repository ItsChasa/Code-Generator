# Code Generator
You know those servers with "generator" bots, like `!gen nordvpn`? This is the code for them.

### How it works:
* You add codes/logins/whatever in a file.
* People with the role can do -generate and get a random code from the file.
* It removes the code and sends it to the user.
* They have a cooldown of x amount of time.

### Features
* Logging: Every single thing that happens is logged in a file.
* Everything is customisable.
